            <p>
                From 23 to 25 January 2023, I participated in the <a href="https://codegamejam.extragames.fr/editions-precedentes/edition-7-soon/" target="_blank">7th edition of the Code Game Jam</a>.
                It is a video game creation event, by team, on a given theme.
                This year, the theme was "masters of time".
            </p>
            <p>
                I teamed up with 5 classmates to design this game during this 30 hours adventure.
                We chose to make a bullet-dodging game with an ability to stop time.
                You can find and play the game on <a href="https://mikachue.itch.io/temporal-rift" target="_blank">Mikachue's itch.io page</a>.
                My work on this was mostly about drawing, game design, with a bit of coding.
                Overall, our game was quite well received, as it received the second prize out of 36 teams.
            </p>

            <h2>What I learned from it</h2>
            <p>
                This project was mostly about time and skill management. We needed to be quick and assign the tasks to make the best use out of each member.
                I mainly learned about gamedesign, including what to do to give the player the best experience possible, without frustrating them nor making the game too easy.
                I also re-discovered Unity and editing softwares, to make the games assets and mechanics.
            </p>

            <h2>Skills put to use</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Unity</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>Game design</li>
            </ul>
